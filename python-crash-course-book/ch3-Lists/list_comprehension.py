# 4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example,
# the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that
# is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out
# the value of each cube.


# 4-9. Cube Comprehension: Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the
