# Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt
# Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as
# keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you
# can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the
# dictionary


# fhand = input('words.txt: ')
# fopen = open(fhand)
# dic = dict()
# count = 0
# for line in fopen:
#     words = line.split()
#     for word in words:
#         count = count + 1
#         # print(word,count)
#         if word not in dic:
#             dic[word] = count
# found = False
# if 'Python'  in dic:
#     found = True
# else:
#     found = False
# print(dic) 
# print(found)
